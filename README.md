## Overview

**renumber** is a simple command-line utility that renumbers Rust tests and benchmarks.

It is particularly useful when a single test or benchmark file contains multiple functions
that don't require meaningful names, such as in test-driven development (TDD).
**renumber** renames these functions sequentially as `_0001`, `_0002`, `_0003`, and so on.

## Example

### Input file

```shell
$ cat ./tests/test_doc.rs
```

Output:

```rust
#[test]
fn _one_should_be_equal_to_one() {
  assert_eq!(1, 1);
}

#[test]
fn _one_should_not_be_equal_to_two() {
  assert_ne!(1, 2);
}

#[test]
fn _first_name_should_be_shorter_than_the_second() {
  let first_name = "John";
  let second_name = "Alexander";
  assert!(first_name.cmp(&second_name).is_gt());
}
```

**NOTE**: Test names begin with underscore, otherwise **renumber** will skip it.

### Renumbering

```shell
$ renumber ./tests/test_doc.rs
```

### Input file after renumbering

```rust
#[test]
fn _0001() {
  assert_eq!(1, 1);
}

#[test]
fn _0002() {
  assert_ne!(1, 2);
}

#[test]
fn _0003() {
  let first_name = "John";
  let second_name = "Alexander";
  assert!(first_name.cmp(&second_name).is_gt());
}
```

## Hints & Tips

- **renumber** takes a single command-line argument, the input file to be renumbered.
- If renumbering is successful, the input file is **OVERWRITTEN** with the new, renumbered content.
- Only functions annotated with `#[test]` or `#[bench]` and whose names begin with an underscore (`_`) are renamed.
- Numbering starts from **1** (vote for [\#1] üëç to change it).
- The new name follows this pattern: `format!("_{:04}", index)` (vote for [\#2] üëç to change it).
